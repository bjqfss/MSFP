This R code is to implement the examples of the paper "A Multi-Sensor Fusion-based Prognostics Model for Systems with Partially Observable Failure
Modes". 
It contains five files:  method, competing methods, simulation study, case study, demo.

The file "method" contains the code to complete the proposed model. 

The file "competing methods" contains the code to complete the related models for comparison. 

The file "simulation study" contains the code to implement the examples in the section "Simulation studies" of the paper. 

The file "case study" contains the code to implement the examples in the section "Case study" of the paper.

The file "demo" contains the code to implement a simple example.
